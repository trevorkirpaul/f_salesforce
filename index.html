      <h2>Sunday, April 22nd, 2018</h2>
      <p>I've been working as a Web Developer since mid-Febuary. I'm currently on two projects, both using React Native. One of the projects I'm on has to do with SalesForce but I honestly have nothing against it.</p>
      <p>Getting this job was a huge career and lifestyle change for me. I was previously in the service industry as a bar tender but I always knew it was a temporary gig.</p>
      <p>It's been over 2 months now and I still can't believe that this is my life. I truly get to do something I enjoy and get paid for it. I will have to say that the transition has been tough. I've been very busy and I feel like I spend all my time working. Whiles I'm at work I focus in on coding for either of these two projects and this even extends to when I'm home.</p>
      <p>From what I had previously read, before getting this job, a lot of people wouldn't put up with this. I can personally deal with it all because I know that I'm very new at web development and it will definitely take extra time for me to get the work done.</p>
      <p>I've learned so much and there isn't a single job out there that I'd rather do. It's been very rewarding and I'm always excited to wake up on a week day.</p>
      <p>That's basically my life right now. This blog will focus on the small details and my experience at work and at home revolving around coding, web development and my personal growth.</p>
      <p>I'm currently trying to figure out how I'll make this blog, I'm leaning towards RoR with a React front end. I'm definitely going to add in markdown support as well. This will be a great way for me to keep track of this journey and maybe someone will find it entertaining.</p>
      <p>Hopefully it helps my writing skills as well!</p>
